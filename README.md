# Motion_Analysis_Kinect_Sensor
Used Microsoft Kinect to track human motion in real time. 
This project is a software prototype capable of capturing, recording, analyzing and comparing movement patterns using three-dimensional vector angles. 
It combines both the Kinect motion capturing and biomechanics analysis and develops a shot put game improvement solution with coaching.

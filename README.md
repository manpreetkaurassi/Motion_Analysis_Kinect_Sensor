# Motion_Analysis_Kinect_Sensor
Used Microsoft Kinect to track human motion of shot-put throw in real time. 
This project is a software prototype capable of capturing, recording, analyzing and comparing movement patterns using three-dimensional vector angles. 
It combines both the Kinect motion capturing and biomechanics analysis and develops a shot put game improvement solution by comparison with Lanka(Olympics gold medalist).

Output of the Kinect code. 
On clicking start button, player will start the motion of the shot put throw. On completion, the joint points are stored in TEXT file
